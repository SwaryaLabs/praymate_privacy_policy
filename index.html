        <h1>Privacy Policy for Praymate</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 21, 2026</p>

        <p>Welcome to Praymate ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy
            explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application
            "Praymate" (the "App").</p>

        <p>Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please
            do not access the application.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect information that you provide directly to us and information collected automatically when you use
            the App.</p>

        <h3>1.1. Personal Information</h3>
        <p>When you sign up for an account, we collect the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Sign-In:</strong> If you choose to sign up using your Google account, we collect your
                name, email address, and profile picture URL provided by Google.</li>
            <li><strong>Email/Password:</strong> If you choose to sign up using email, we collect your email address and
                a hashed version of your password.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.2. Location Information</h3>
        <p>To provide the core functionality of finding nearby mosques, the App requests access to your device's
            location services.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Precise Location:</strong> We use your precise location (GPS and network-based) to query the
                Google Places Nearby Search API. This allows us to display mosques in your immediate vicinity.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage:</strong> This location data is processed in real-time to fetch mosque details. We do not
                store your historical location trail on our servers unless required for specific community features you
                opt into.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.3. User-Generated Content (Community Data)</h3>
        <p>Praymate relies on a community of users to maintain accurate Jamaat (congregation) schedules.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you choose to add or update a Jamaat schedule for a mosque, the information you submit (prayer times,
                notes) will be visible to other users of the App.</li>
            <li>This data may be associated with your User ID to ensure accountability and prevent spam.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create and manage your account.</li>
            <li>Identify nearby mosques using Google Places API.</li>
            <li>Send you push notifications for prayer times based on your selected preferences (5, 10, or 15 minutes
                prior).</li>
            <li>Manage the "Do Not Disturb" mode automation on your device during prayer times.</li>
            <li>Maintain the database of mosque schedules through community updates.</li>
            <li>Respond to your inquiries and support requests.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Device Permissions</h2>
        <p>The App requests the following permissions on your Android device to function correctly:</p>

            <li><strong>Location (Fine/Coarse):</strong> Required to find mosques near you.</li>
            <li><strong>Notification:</strong> Required to send prayer time reminders.</li>
            <li><strong>Do Not Disturb Access:</strong> Required to automatically silence your phone during prayer times

        </ul>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App utilizes third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. These services
            include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Sign-In Services:</strong> For authentication.</li>

                storage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party services.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
